                    <p> Predictive analytics and forecasting enable businesses to make proactive,
                         data-driven decisions by using historical data combined with machine 
                         learning algorithms to forecast future outcomes. This helps optimize
                          operations, from sales and marketing to supply chain management and
                           customer service. The benefits include improved decision-making,
