                    <p> Predictive analytics and forecasting enable businesses to make proactive,
                         data-driven decisions by using historical data combined with machine 
                         learning algorithms to forecast future outcomes. This helps optimize
                          operations, from sales and marketing to supply chain management and
                           customer service. The benefits include improved decision-making,

                The main module of the application is ‘subscribers’, where each construction company will act as a subscriber. They will have to register themselves according to subscription plans, and also be able to upgrade their plan anytime. The plan is based on the number of projects allowed to run for the subscriber. First, a lead will be created and all the estimate process will be covered then it will convert to a project. Then all the business logic (punch item, warranty, bills, change order, expanse, feedback) will run for the project.
